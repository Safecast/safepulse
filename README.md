# SafePulse

An open-source high-voltage power supply (HVS) and pulse counter designed for Geiger tubes.

## Overview

SafePulse is a project aimed at developing a fully open high-voltage power supply that is high-performance, compact, and has minimal current draw. It is tailored for use with Geiger counters, facilitating radiation detection and measurement.

## Features

- **Open-Source Design**: All design files and source code are available for review and modification.
- **High Performance**: Delivers reliable high-voltage output suitable for Geiger tubes.
- **Compact and Efficient**: Designed to be space-saving with low power consumption.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To work with SafePulse, you may need the following tools and components:
